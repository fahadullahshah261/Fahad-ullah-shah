            "['We stayed one night before going on a cruise the next day.  We were so happy with the service at check -in from the guest service manager.  He was very friendly and so accommodating to our needs and was able to make a, what we thought would be a hard process, an easy one.    The room was spacious and clean.    It was a bonus that it is a short walk to all the shops and restaurants by the pier.   We would DEFINITELY stay here again.', 'We had a great experience at the Courtyard by Marriott Downtown Miami, Florida.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The room was very clean, the bed was excellent for my back condition. I would definitely recommend this hotel for future stays.', 'We spent the day/night here before catching a cruise out of Miami.  It was walking distance to Bayside Marketplace or a short free train ride.  (Well worth a visit for shopping and dining.)  The staff were awesome.  The facility was clean and inviting.  The Bistro was great and there were many other dining options close by.  I was very happy that they allowed us an early check-in on a Saturday morning which allowed us a chance to freshen up from an early morning flight.  Be aware that their pool is under construction and sounds like it has been quite a while.   They had an arrangement with a nearby hotel for pool use if needed.  Another awesome plus to this hotel is that they arranged a shuttle to the cruise port for $10/person.  The cruise port was super congested, so the shuttle was a lifesaver.  Like most Marriott properties - this is a good one.  …', 'Stayed here 1 day before my cruise and really enjoyed it.  They give you the opportunity to let them know your arrival time, which was early evening for me.  When I arrived, it was like they already knew it was me.  The property is walking distance to many different attractions.  They offer a Pub to have a cocktail and relax without having to leave the property.  They made arrangements to take a shuttle to the cruise port directly from the hotel, which I greatly appreciated.  I would definitely recommend and stay here again.', 'A good location in downtown Miami.   Hotel was clean as was our room.   Room was nothing special, usual hotel type.   There is no restaurant.   Whomever designed the handicap room was not handicapped.   There is not a walk-in shower but rather a bathtub and the grab bar near the toilet has a marble shelf above it making it difficult to use.   Recommend for a convenient location.   Rating...good.', 'First of all, the pool does not exist. There is just a big hole in the roof and it doesn’t even look like it’s being worked on. We actually had to go and pay money at another hotel to use their pool for the day. Our first room had a terrible smell to it. Luckily the front desk moved us to another room without any difficulty. There was one gentleman working the front desk (I did not get his name) seemed miserable every time I went to the lobby and was very unfriendly whenever I asked a question.The street right outside the hotel is full of homeless and smells like urine. I think there are several other better hotels to choose from in the area, especially if you want a pool to use.', 'This hotel gets heavy use by people the night before their cruise, as well as various tour groups. So you’d expect it to have that “wear and tear” look.  We didn’t notice any. We were staying one night following disembarking our cruise early on a Sunday morning. We got to the hotel at 9:30 am, and knew that we’d have to drop off our luggage to be stored. Though the lobby was filled with groups who’d been checking out, a friendly & professional front desk person immediately waited on us and took our things. He told us the hotel had been 100% full the prior night, and couldn’t say when our room might be ready. I had booked a specific type of room - top floor, with a balcony. Waiting for those to be cleaned vs other rooms could be longer, so we said we’d be fine with any room. He gave us directions to the Bayside Market, which is a large indoor-outdoor shopping plaza. So we ambled the half mile or so over, and spent as much time as we could walking around it, people watching, boat watching, and finally got an early lunch.   At 1:00, we decided to walk back to the hotel to see what rooms might have been cleaned by then. As luck would have it, we talked with the day manager at the desk. She said that our requested type of room wasn’t available, but since we were also Marriott Bonvoy members, she could instead upgrade us to a 2 room suite. She asked if we’d mind not being on the top floor. Heck no! The suite was at the end of a hall, overlooking an area that had lots of traffic noise.  But that lessened by evening, especially as this was a Sunday.   The two rooms were great. The best part was the living room with its big puffy sofa that had a large matching ottoman for two. The king bedroom also had a nice small sofa, and was decorated in a way that suggested a recent remodeling. The bed was quite comfortable for sleeping, along with two of the four pillows. Plenty of plugs and USB ports in lamps in both rooms. The only disappointment was the rather small bathroom. Though it had a nice shower, the small sink had no real counter. And the toilet was crowded between the two. But not a problem for any short stay.   Here’s the best part - and I assume the same for every room in the hotel. It has connections to about 6-7 streaming services. If you have an account with one, you can log onto it and watch the same as you would at home. Because we got into the room by 1:30, we had lots of time to kill. And we had already walked over 2 miles in the morning. So we enjoyed watching Netflix for hours, with our feet on the comfy ottoman. Went to the small New York Pizza for dinner later, as it was one of the nearest places to go to. We did remember to log out of our Netflix account before going to bed. We’d easily forget to do that in the morning, as we had to be out of the hotel by 6:00 am to catch our early flight.   In summary, the desk staff were great in handling all the people it needed to deal with, our upgraded room was wonderful, and the hotel is located well for walking to several big shopping areas. It was incredibly close to Port Miami, so we will probably stay there in the future.…', 'Check-in was great.  Housekeeping is great.    The low rating is due to a couple of things.  When I asked for a late checkout because I had a late flight (I was willing to pay), I was told no because the hotel was \"completely booked\\'.   I went to the hotel website and selected three rooms, and there was availability.  I have a screenshot.    The room is DARK and dated (popcorn ceiling dated). Needs more lighting.  I could not see to put on my make-up.  No make-up mirror.', 'We wanted an affordable hotel in a safe,  walkable area near restaurants and shopping. The bed was so comfortable. The staff at the small restaurant and lounge were friendly. We were able to check in early when we got off the cruise ship in the morning.', 'We were staying overnight to catch a cruise the next morning.  This is a terrific hotel to choose.  They were so accommodating, the food in the restaurant is above any hotel offerings we have had since the pandemic and the hotel staff was polite, friendly and very customer service oriented.  They arranged our transfer to the cruise ship the next day and it was so convenient.  Excellent choice :)', 'I stayed at the this hotel for two nights this past week.    They never told me that they were doing insanely loud construction on the hotel during the day.  I wish I could post the video I took, you can hear the crazy sounds.  If you plan on being at the hotel during the daytime, I suggest you book another hotel.  You can’t work and you can’t sleep.  I complained and no one cared.  Their initial reaction was “didn’t they tell you?,” and they seemed very concerned about hunting down the person who didn’t tell me when I checked in rather than fixing the problem.  Another employee insisted that it was mentioned on their web site (it’s not mentioned).  No apologies, no accommodations.  They did offer to move me to a room with two beds (not a fit for me), but that’s it.    To the…', 'Wonderful location in downtown Miami, close to everything, including Whole Foods across the street, even a post office in the other direction and restaurants in every direction. I was part of a tour, treated very well by the staff who called a taxi for me several times. Thank goodness I did that because I left my book bag in the taxi that took me to the airport …..!!!! No problem because I called the hotel and they connected me right away with the taxi driver and he turned around and brought it back yo me, happiness!', 'Stayed the night before a cruise. We got a suite facing the road which the traffic sounded like our window was open on the 8th floor.  The room was very nice and clean.  The breakfast left a lot to be desired.  The shuttle to the ship was $12 per person which we had to sign up for when we checked in.   It was dark when we arrived and asked for a nearby restaurant. We went to the first place we saw which was two blocks up and a small buffet which was just ok.  I should have searched on my phone but not being familiar with the area, we settled.   The breakfast left a lot to be desired.  If you choose to stay here, try to get a room in the back of the hotel where the road noise won’t be so disturbing.', 'Excellent location, plenty of restaurants within walking distance.  The room was very clean, staff was extremely friendly and courteous.   Stayed pre cruise and was perfect location and property. Staff was there to please…I would recommend this location.', 'I went to run the Miami marathon. The hotel was close to the starting and finishing point of the marathon. the rooms are very comfortable and clean.  close to stores, restaurants and to the train station.', 'I booked the larger king room with a pull out sofa for my Son and girlfriend. When I went into the room it was a very small room. Not the larger room I asked for. When I pulled out the bed it was so tiny that I don’t think one person could sleep in it let alone two. I went downstairs to voice my concerns and they moved me across the hall. The room was larger but the pull out bed was a joke. Again very small and barely accommodated my family. Very disappointed in the room. The restaurant was decent and the location is good. The noise on the city side of the hotel was all night. I would suggest ear plugs.', \"The hotel, staff and food was excellent but the traffic right outside the hotel was horrible. Not sure what was going on but it seemed as if some peeps were doing illegal street racing. Their loud exhaust echos between the buildings making it even louder. You can clearly hear this from your room like you where on the street. This went on till 2am when the cops finally put a stop to it. Also the pillows suck, not sure what it is but hotels now don't even carry firm pillows anymore. Every one on the bed would be completely flat when I put my head down. They were useless as pillows. I get it that some people like to sleep on these useless pillows but provide at least a firm pillow or two on the bed for others who don't. This also was the case with a Hilton I stayed at in November.…\", 'Good location for Bayside area. We were not advised the pool was closed for construction which was a pity. Room spacious but dated decor. Very clean but bathroom needs renovation. Bistro had very limited menu. Expensive for what you get but so are most Miami hotels', 'I was satisfied with the location of the hotel, the service of the staff and the cleanliness of the room.Shopping and daily necessities are available in downtown areas.I would like to visit again soon.It was the best place to relax.', \"The beds are full size, not queen. The rooms are not serviced daily, not even a knock to see if you want coffee or trash pick up. Parking is an astronomical $43 a day, breakfast was not included and no water was offered despite gold member status. The most annoying thing was the elevators. Both were broken down during our stay and the entire hotel was using one service elevator. It was too cold for the pool but we were not informed at any point during our booking that the pool is also under construction. Overall, we stay here for the location. This is our second time and we go to MIA often.  It's a great location but be forewarned that the homeless situation is heavy immediately outside of the hotel.\", \"Very good stay to get to our cruise. Well-greeted, quick check-in and a bottle of water to top it off!!! Pleasant, professional staff all over. Dinner and breakfast were very convenient in the lobby, tasty too. They have a small snack shop in the lobby. There is a shuttle bus, $10.00 per person to take you to the docks. There's a CVS and other shops nearby as well.  Located very close to the Tram station too. Beds are comfy and the room is clean. Good stay.\", 'We had a great stay at the Courtyard Miami. Excellent location and service from the staff. Comfortable quiet room…it was perfect for our pre-cruise stay. We also enjoyed an evening cocktail and a breakfast at the bistro. It had been a few years since we were here last and the hotel did not disappoint!', 'Aspen, and Deja were fantastic!!!!! Very nice and inviting vibes!! Fantastic drinks!! Great conversation!! Bartenders had no problem making me specific drinks and did really great doing them. Definitely will be back just for the bartenders!!!', 'This hotel is your typical Courtyard Inn and it is located in a great part of town central to many areas of Miami you can walk to but the rooms themselves are tired and in need of an update. The lobby is comfortable and there is a nice restaurant area but the rooms are not great. We had an Executive Suite but the furniture in the rooms is old and outdated and could really use a makeover. Overall an ok stay since got it free with points but I would not have booked this hotel if had to actually pay for it.', 'Great location to get to downton places and for taking walks, the staff is excelent and helped us in everything we ask for: places to eat, visit where to buy different things. There is a whole foods accross the street.', 'Thank you for the room upgrade, we were very happy! Nice hotel downtown in Miami. Spacious room on the 14th floor with balcony, large and very comfortable bed, bathroom with large shower. Generally a clean, spacious, nice hotel. To be recommended for a trip to Miami. The bistro in the hotel was okay, the selection at breakfast visible at a glance, what was available was delicious. Very nice helpful Staff at check in and room service.', 'The hotel was in a nice location that made it easy to walk around and see the surrounding sights. The food offered at the hotel was very good as well, and the beds were comfortable. We went to a wedding on a cruise, and the port was very close to this hotel.', 'I arrived early and they helped me with the management of the room. Every day I felt how they went out of their way to make me feel good with small details. The restaurant, always very well attended whatever your requirement: breakfast, lunch or dinner. The receptionists magically solve any requirement. His smile also helps to feel at home. Finally, its proximity to the financial center Brickell and Downtown allow fast and safe travel.', 'Stayed at the courtyard Marriott. Downtown Miami. Came late. night crew was wonderful. Upgraded me, provided me with bottled water - All for free - and was gracious and very accommodating after such a long night at the airport.', 'My Boyfriend and I have stayed here numerous times every time we go to Miami on vacation! It’s a GREAT location just a quick car ride or walk to Brickell, Bayside and tons of popular restaurants. The hotel is consistent every time we stay here with cleanliness, modern interior and beautiful rooms. I look forward to their Starbucks chai latte and their quinoa egg breakfast! The staff is what makes this hotel a five star for us! They’re always smiling, welcoming and knowledgeable about the area and where to go for a nice dinner, some fun etcStay here you won’t regret it!!', 'This is a nice hotel located right in the heart of downtown Miami. We were greeted courteously upon arrival. Our room was on the top floor and we had a nice view outside. Housekeeping did an excellent job taking care of our group of four. This was an overall great stay', 'Very bad property. The only saving grace is it’s location. The hotel is very dated. The rooms had a peculiar musky smell. I usually don’t fret about upgrades etc. (close to getting Platinum Bonvoy status), and not that I asked, but all I got was 2 bottles of water as a welcome gift. Another thing that put me off was the service. While the staff was courteous, I had called down for some extra towels and some plastic utensils, and was told since they are short staffed I would have to come down and get it myself. I wasn’t in a hurry and said I could wait until someone was available, and was told no one can bring it up, if I wanted it, I would have to come down and get it myself.  Too overpriced just for location. I would not recommend this hotel based on service, room cleanliness…', \"every day my room was freshened up with clean towels and toiletries which hasn't been occurring since the onset of COVID.  The hotel staff were super friendly and most accommodating.  The pool was closed for renovations so I can't provide any comments for the pool.  The bar and restaurant was great, really good food with exceptional employees.   The hotel is clean, well situated with convenient parking levels attached directly to the hotel with elevator service.\", 'The Good, The Bad, The Ugly:  The Good:   You have 5 star employees working at a 1 star hotel. Andrew (I believe his name is) and another female employee at the front desk were phenomenal, friendly and helpful. The same goes for the gentleman at the Starbucks bistro inside the hotel. That’s unfortunately where it ended for us.   The Bad:  The pool has been closed since March for renovations. We knew when we booked that the pool was closed, however did not think it still would be in July…so maybe our fault a little on that. There was an alternative that you could go swimming at the hotel across the highway if you were daring enough to play Frogger to get there. We did not with our young son.   The Ugly:  The photos of this hotel are very misleading on their website. The rooms are…', 'Our family of 8 booked the Courtyard Brickell for lodging the night before a cruise. We were warmly greeted by the on duty Manager (Frank) and he worked hard to find us adjoining rooms to expedite our family activities and communication.  He also provided several local tips on dining, points of interest we could walk or Uber to quickly, and outlined the pros and cons of various transport plans to the port for the cruise.  Everyone we interacted with at the hotel was friendly and had customer service front of mind.  The hotel had notified us of pool maintenance that would keep the kids from swimming-the “heads up” before hand helped us set expectations and find some other activities for the grandkids. Since we had a long delay between our disembarkation from the cruise and our…', 'This Marriot has a Very friendly and nice service. I came here for a four day conference. Andrew manage to keep me a room during very busy period. Moreover, he got me a rather nice and clean room with a huge balcony. Really appreciate and love his kind offer and help.', 'We were flying into Miami after flights/stopover of 26 hours. Had mailed the hotel a day earlier stating that we were likely to land up a couple of hours before the 4pm check in time. We reached the hotel at noon and were in our room in under 5 minutes. Checked in by super efficient Kimberley. The room was large with 2 queen beds, a nice city view and looked freshly painted. The bathroom was spotless. At check in we requested for house keeping every alternate day and this was done as per our request. We were there for 5 days. Very efficient and helpful front desk led by Frank Espinola. Great team, really customer focused. Thanks guys!!', \"Courtyard Miami was fantastic to us. The top floor room offered a balcony that provided an overview of the busy yet beautiful Miami city life. Parking can be a little tricky but the parking garage allows access into the hotel once you're checked in. I would recommend the Courtyard at Miami anyway!\", 'the room and the hotel facilities were very clean, the balcony has an amazing view of the city and the staff was very attentive and friendly, the guy at the front desk amdrew was amazing and very nice!', 'This hotel is 150% amazing. I can’t stress it enough I truly enjoyed my stay they staff is great, and I mean great everyone! was extremely helpful and nice very quick response to everything down to food they really can point you in the right direction.

Looking forward to trying the food!', 'The staff and location of the hotel were excellent. The room was also clean and spacious. The breakfast was also great. This is the perfect location in preparation for a cruise or just to check out the restaurants in the area. Will definitely stay here again!', \"Stayed at this property for a business trip, traveling with multiple colleagues. For what it is, the hotel does its job. I feel this hotel would be excellent for a quick pre/post cruise hotel.   My group's biggest knock of the hotel was the bathrooms. While the hotel rooms all felt rather spacious (more so than other standard hotel rooms), the bathrooms were strangely small. I also felt that the condition of the bathroom was rather poor. Dated, and considerable wear and tear. I'd urge the hotel's ownership to look at refreshing this aspect of their hotel to be more competitive in the Brickell market.

The staff was amazing the manager at the hotel really tried his best to accommodate us the best way possible knowing they were completely booked up due to the Bad Bunny Concert. It was in a perfect location, the hotel is a little outdated in the rooms but that didn’t take away from the overall experience. The staff was always so courteous ready to help in any way possible. Possibly the best Marriott stay I’ve had in a very long time!! I could go on and on about the attention and customer service provided. It is a super clean hotel and I plan on booking them again during my next stay in Miami.', \"Friendly, welcoming and fantastic service.  Front desk recommended a wonderful Italian restaurant around the corner that was amazing.  The hotel bar makes one the BEST Black Cherry Old Fashioned that I've ever had!

We were so happy with the service at check -in from the guest service manager.  He was very friendly and so accommodating to our needs and was able to make a, what we thought would be a hard process, an easy one.    The room was spacious and clean.    It was a bonus that it is a short walk to all the shops and restaurants by the pier.   We would DEFINITELY stay here again.\", \"We had a great experience at the Courtyard by Marriott Downtown Miami, Florida.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The room was very clean, the bed was excellent for my back condition. I would definitely recommend this hotel for future stays.\", \"We spent the day/night here before catching a cruise out of Miami.  It was walking distance to Bayside Marketplace or a short free train ride.  (Well worth a visit for shopping and dining.)  The staff were awesome.  The facility was clean and inviting.  The Bistro was great and there were many other dining options close by.  I was very happy that they allowed us an early check-in on a Saturday morning which allowed us a chance to freshen up from an early morning flight.  Be aware that their pool is under construction and sounds like it has been quite a while.   They had an arrangement with a nearby hotel for pool use if needed.  Another awesome plus to this hotel is that they arranged a shuttle to the cruise port for $10/person.  The cruise port was super congested, so the shuttle was a lifesaver.  Like most Marriott properties - this is a good one.  \\\\u2026\", \"Stayed here 1 day before my cruise and really enjoyed it.  They give you the opportunity to let them know your arrival time, which was early evening for me.  When I arrived, it was like they already knew it was me.  The property is walking distance to many different attractions.  They offer a Pub to have a cocktail and relax without having to leave the property.  They made arrangements to take a shuttle to the cruise port directly from the hotel, which I greatly appreciated.  I would definitely recommend and stay here again.\", \"A good location in downtown Miami.   Hotel was clean as was our room.   Room was nothing special, usual hotel type.   There is no restaurant.   Whomever designed the handicap room was not handicapped.   There is not a walk-in shower but rather a bathtub and the grab bar near the toilet has a marble shelf above it making it difficult to use.   Recommend for a convenient location.   Rating...good.\", \"First of all, the pool does not exist. There is just a big hole in the roof and it doesn\\\\u2019t even look like it\\\\u2019s being worked on. We actually had to go and pay money at another hotel to use their pool for the day. Our first room had a terrible smell to it. Luckily the front desk moved us to another room without any difficulty. There was one gentleman working the front desk (I did not get his name) seemed miserable every time I went to the lobby and was very unfriendly whenever I asked a question.The street right outside the hotel is full of homeless and smells like urine. I think there are several other better hotels to choose from in the area, especially if you want a pool to use.\", \"This hotel gets heavy use by people the night before their cruise, as well as various tour groups. So you\\\\u2019d expect it to have that \\\\u201cwear and tear\\\\u201d look.  We didn\\\\u2019t notice any. We were staying one night following disembarking our cruise early on a Sunday morning. We got to the hotel at 9:30 am, and knew that we\\\\u2019d have to drop off our luggage to be stored. Though the lobby was filled with groups who\\\\u2019d been checking out, a friendly & professional front desk person immediately waited on us and took our things. He told us the hotel had been 100% full the prior night, and couldn\\\\u2019t say when our room might be ready. I had booked a specific type of room - top floor, with a balcony. Waiting for those to be cleaned vs other rooms could be longer, so we said we\\\\u2019d be fine with any room. He gave us directions to the Bayside Market, which is a large indoor-outdoor shopping plaza. So we ambled the half mile or so over, and spent as much time as we could walking around it, people watching, boat watching, and finally got an early lunch.   At 1:00, we decided to walk back to the hotel to see what rooms might have been cleaned by then. As luck would have it, we talked with the day manager at the desk. She said that our requested type of room wasn\\\\u2019t available, but since we were also Marriott Bonvoy members, she could instead upgrade us to a 2 room suite. She asked if we\\\\u2019d mind not being on the top floor. Heck no! The suite was at the end of a hall, overlooking an area that had lots of traffic noise.  But that lessened by evening, especially as this was a Sunday.   The two rooms were great. The best part was the living room with its big puffy sofa that had a large matching ottoman for two. The king bedroom also had a nice small sofa, and was decorated in a way that suggested a recent remodeling. The bed was quite comfortable for sleeping, along with two of the four pillows. Plenty of plugs and USB ports in lamps in both rooms. The only disappointment was the rather small bathroom. Though it had a nice shower, the small sink had no real counter. And the toilet was crowded between the two. But not a problem for any short stay.   Here\\\\u2019s the best part - and I assume the same for every room in the hotel. It has connections to about 6-7 streaming services. If you have an account with one, you can log onto it and watch the same as you would at home. Because we got into the room by 1:30, we had lots of time to kill. And we had already walked over 2 miles in the morning. So we enjoyed watching Netflix for hours, with our feet on the comfy ottoman. Went to the small New York Pizza for dinner later, as it was one of the nearest places to go to. We did remember to log out of our Netflix account before going to bed. We\\\\u2019d easily forget to do that in the morning, as we had to be out of the hotel by 6:00 am to catch our early flight.   In summary, the desk staff were great in handling all the people it needed to deal with, our upgraded room was wonderful, and the hotel is located well for walking to several big shopping areas. It was incredibly close to Port Miami, so we will probably stay there in the future.\\\\u2026\", \"Check-in was great.  Housekeeping is great.    The low rating is due to a couple of things.  When I asked for a late checkout because I had a late flight (I was willing to pay), I was told no because the hotel was \\\\\"completely booked\\'.   I went to the hotel website and selected three rooms, and there was availability.  I have a screenshot.    The room is DARK and dated (popcorn ceiling dated). Needs more lighting.  I could not see to put on my make-up.  No make-up mirror.\", \"We wanted an affordable hotel in a safe,  walkable area near restaurants and shopping. The bed was so comfortable. The staff at the small restaurant and lounge were friendly. We were able to check in early when we got off the cruise ship in the morning.\", \"We were staying overnight to catch a cruise the next morning.  This is a terrific hotel to choose.  They were so accommodating, the food in the restaurant is above any hotel offerings we have had since the pandemic and the hotel staff was polite, friendly and very customer service oriented.  They arranged our transfer to the cruise ship the next day and it was so convenient.  Excellent choice :)\", \"I stayed at the this hotel for two nights this past week.    They never told me that they were doing insanely loud construction on the hotel during the day.  I wish I could post the video I took, you can hear the crazy sounds.  If you plan on being at the hotel during the daytime, I suggest you book another hotel.  You can\\\\u2019t work and you can\\\\u2019t sleep.  I complained and no one cared.  Their initial reaction was \\\\u201cdidn\\\\u2019t they tell you?,\\\\u201d and they seemed very concerned about hunting down the person who didn\\\\u2019t tell me when I checked in rather than fixing the problem.  Another employee insisted that it was mentioned on their web site (it\\\\u2019s not mentioned).  No apologies, no accommodations.  They did offer to move me to a room with two beds (not a fit for me), but that\\\\u2019s it.    To the\\\\u2026\", \"Wonderful location in downtown Miami, close to everything, including Whole Foods across the street, even a post office in the other direction and restaurants in every direction. I was part of a tour, treated very well by the staff who called a taxi for me several times. Thank goodness I did that because I left my book bag in the taxi that took me to the airport \\\\u2026..!!!! No problem because I called the hotel and they connected me right away with the taxi driver and he turned around and brought it back yo me, happiness!\", \"Stayed the night before a cruise. We got a suite facing the road which the traffic sounded like our window was open on the 8th floor.  The room was very nice and clean.  The breakfast left a lot to be desired.  The shuttle to the ship was $12 per person which we had to sign up for when we checked in.   It was dark when we arrived and asked for a nearby restaurant. We went to the first place we saw which was two blocks up and a small buffet which was just ok.  I should have searched on my phone but not being familiar with the area, we settled.   The breakfast left a lot to be desired.  If you choose to stay here, try to get a room in the back of the hotel where the road noise won\\\\u2019t be so disturbing.\", \"Excellent location, plenty of restaurants within walking distance.  The room was very clean, staff was extremely friendly and courteous.   Stayed pre cruise and was perfect location and property. Staff was there to please\\\\u2026I would recommend this location.\", \"I went to run the Miami marathon. The hotel was close to the starting and finishing point of the marathon. the rooms are very comfortable and clean.  close to stores, restaurants and to the train station.\", \"I booked the larger king room with a pull out sofa for my Son and girlfriend. When I went into the room it was a very small room. Not the larger room I asked for. When I pulled out the bed it was so tiny that I don\\\\u2019t think one person could sleep in it let alone two. I went downstairs to voice my concerns and they moved me across the hall. The room was larger but the pull out bed was a joke. Again very small and barely accommodated my family. Very disappointed in the room. The restaurant was decent and the location is good. The noise on the city side of the hotel was all night. I would suggest ear plugs.\", \"The hotel, staff and food was excellent but the traffic right outside the hotel was horrible. Not sure what was going on but it seemed as if some peeps were doing illegal street racing. Their loud exhaust echos between the buildings making it even louder. You can clearly hear this from your room like you where on the street. This went on till 2am when the cops finally put a stop to it. Also the pillows suck, not sure what it is but hotels now don\\'t even carry firm pillows anymore. Every one on the bed would be completely flat when I put my head down. They were useless as pillows. I get it that some people like to sleep on these useless pillows but provide at least a firm pillow or two on the bed for others who don\\'t. This also was the case with a Hilton I stayed at in November.\\\\u2026\", \"Good location for Bayside area. We were not advised the pool was closed for construction which was a pity. Room spacious but dated decor. Very clean but bathroom needs renovation. Bistro had very limited menu. Expensive for what you get but so are most Miami hotels\", \"I was satisfied with the location of the hotel, the service of the staff and the cleanliness of the room.Shopping and daily necessities are available in downtown areas.I would like to visit again soon.It was the best place to relax.\", \"The beds are full size, not queen. The rooms are not serviced daily, not even a knock to see if you want coffee or trash pick up. Parking is an astronomical $43 a day, breakfast was not included and no water was offered despite gold member status. The most annoying thing was the elevators. Both were broken down during our stay and the entire hotel was using one service elevator. It was too cold for the pool but we were not informed at any point during our booking that the pool is also under construction. Overall, we stay here for the location. This is our second time and we go to MIA often.  It\\'s a great location but be forewarned that the homeless situation is heavy immediately outside of the hotel.\", \"Very good stay to get to our cruise. Well-greeted, quick check-in and a bottle of water to top it off!!! Pleasant, professional staff all over. Dinner and breakfast were very convenient in the lobby, tasty too. They have a small snack shop in the lobby. There is a shuttle bus, $10.00 per person to take you to the docks. There\\'s a CVS and other shops nearby as well.  Located very close to the Tram station too. Beds are comfy and the room is clean. Good stay.\", \"We had a great stay at the Courtyard Miami. Excellent location and service from the staff. Comfortable quiet room\\\\u2026it was perfect for our pre-cruise stay. We also enjoyed an evening cocktail and a breakfast at the bistro. It had been a few years since we were here last and the hotel did not disappoint!\", \"Aspen, and Deja were fantastic!!!!! Very nice and inviting vibes!! Fantastic drinks!! Great conversation!! Bartenders had no problem making me specific drinks and did really great doing them. Definitely will be back just for the bartenders!!!\", \"This hotel is your typical Courtyard Inn and it is located in a great part of town central to many areas of Miami you can walk to but the rooms themselves are tired and in need of an update. The lobby is comfortable and there is a nice restaurant area but the rooms are not great. We had an Executive Suite but the furniture in the rooms is old and outdated and could really use a makeover. Overall an ok stay since got it free with points but I would not have booked this hotel if had to actually pay for it.\", \"Great location to get to downton places and for taking walks, the staff is excelent and helped us in everything we ask for: places to eat, visit where to buy different things. There is a whole foods accross the street.\", \"Thank you for the room upgrade, we were very happy! Nice hotel downtown in Miami. Spacious room on the 14th floor with balcony, large and very comfortable bed, bathroom with large shower. Generally a clean, spacious, nice hotel. To be recommended for a trip to Miami. The bistro in the hotel was okay, the selection at breakfast visible at a glance, what was available was delicious. Very nice helpful Staff at check in and room service.\", \"The hotel was in a nice location that made it easy to walk around and see the surrounding sights. The food offered at the hotel was very good as well, and the beds were comfortable. We went to a wedding on a cruise, and the port was very close to this hotel.\", \"I arrived early and they helped me with the management of the room. Every day I felt how they went out of their way to make me feel good with small details. The restaurant, always very well attended whatever your requirement: breakfast, lunch or dinner. The receptionists magically solve any requirement. His smile also helps to feel at home. Finally, its proximity to the financial center Brickell and Downtown allow fast and safe travel.\", \"Stayed at the courtyard Marriott. Downtown Miami. Came late. night crew was wonderful. Upgraded me, provided me with bottled water - All for free - and was gracious and very accommodating after such a long night at the airport.\", \"My Boyfriend and I have stayed here numerous times every time we go to Miami on vacation! It\\\\u2019s a GREAT location just a quick car ride or walk to Brickell, Bayside and tons of popular restaurants. The hotel is consistent every time we stay here with cleanliness, modern interior and beautiful rooms. I look forward to their Starbucks chai latte and their quinoa egg breakfast! The staff is what makes this hotel a five star for us! They\\\\u2019re always smiling, welcoming and knowledgeable about the area and where to go for a nice dinner, some fun etcStay here you won\\\\u2019t regret it!!\", \"This is a nice hotel located right in the heart of downtown Miami. We were greeted courteously upon arrival. Our room was on the top floor and we had a nice view outside. Housekeeping did an excellent job taking care of our group of four. This was an overall great stay\", \"Very bad property. The only saving grace is it\\\\u2019s location. The hotel is very dated. The rooms had a peculiar musky smell. I usually don\\\\u2019t fret about upgrades etc. (close to getting Platinum Bonvoy status), and not that I asked, but all I got was 2 bottles of water as a welcome gift. Another thing that put me off was the service. While the staff was courteous, I had called down for some extra towels and some plastic utensils, and was told since they are short staffed I would have to come down and get it myself. I wasn\\\\u2019t in a hurry and said I could wait until someone was available, and was told no one can bring it up, if I wanted it, I would have to come down and get it myself.  Too overpriced just for location. I would not recommend this hotel based on service, room cleanliness\\\\u2026\", \"every day my room was freshened up with clean towels and toiletries which hasn\\'t been occurring since the onset of COVID.  The hotel staff were super friendly and most accommodating.  The pool was closed for renovations so I can\\'t provide any comments for the pool.  The bar and restaurant was great, really good food with exceptional employees.   The hotel is clean, well situated with convenient parking levels attached directly to the hotel with elevator service.\", \"The Good, The Bad, The Ugly:  The Good:   You have 5 star employees working at a 1 star hotel. Andrew (I believe his name is) and another female employee at the front desk were phenomenal, friendly and helpful. The same goes for the gentleman at the Starbucks bistro inside the hotel. That\\\\u2019s unfortunately where it ended for us.   The Bad:  The pool has been closed since March for renovations. We knew when we booked that the pool was closed, however did not think it still would be in July\\\\u2026so maybe our fault a little on that. There was an alternative that you could go swimming at the hotel across the highway if you were daring enough to play Frogger to get there. We did not with our young son.   The Ugly:  The photos of this hotel are very misleading on their website. The rooms are\\\\u2026\", \"Our family of 8 booked the Courtyard Brickell for lodging the night before a cruise. We were warmly greeted by the on duty Manager (Frank) and he worked hard to find us adjoining rooms to expedite our family activities and communication.  He also provided several local tips on dining, points of interest we could walk or Uber to quickly, and outlined the pros and cons of various transport plans to the port for the cruise.  Everyone we interacted with at the hotel was friendly and had customer service front of mind.  The hotel had notified us of pool maintenance that would keep the kids from swimming-the \\\\u201cheads up\\\\u201d before hand helped us set expectations and find some other activities for the grandkids. Since we had a long delay between our disembarkation from the cruise and our\\\\u2026\", \"This Marriot has a Very friendly and nice service. I came here for a four day conference. Andrew manage to keep me a room during very busy period. Moreover, he got me a rather nice and clean room with a huge balcony. Really appreciate and love his kind offer and help.\", \"We were flying into Miami after flights/stopover of 26 hours. Had mailed the hotel a day earlier stating that we were likely to land up a couple of hours before the 4pm check in time. We reached the hotel at noon and were in our room in under 5 minutes. Checked in by super efficient Kimberley. The room was large with 2 queen beds, a nice city view and looked freshly painted. The bathroom was spotless. At check in we requested for house keeping every alternate day and this was done as per our request. We were there for 5 days. Very efficient and helpful front desk led by Frank Espinola. Great team, really customer focused. Thanks guys!!\", \"Courtyard Miami was fantastic to us. The top floor room offered a balcony that provided an overview of the busy yet beautiful Miami city life. Parking can be a little tricky but the parking garage allows access into the hotel once you\\'re checked in. I would recommend the Courtyard at Miami anyway!\", \"the room and the hotel facilities were very clean, the balcony has an amazing view of the city and the staff was very attentive and friendly, the guy at the front desk amdrew was amazing and very nice!\", \"This hotel is 150% amazing.

I feel this hotel would be excellent for a quick pre/post cruise hotel.   My group\\'s biggest knock of the hotel was the bathrooms.
